  **Introduction to HTML**


  HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create
  web pages. It provides the basic structure of a website, which is then
  enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.


  ### What is HTML?


  HTML is a markup language, which means it uses tags to annotate text, images,
  and other content for display in a web browser. These tags tell the browser
  how to display the content on the page.


  ### Basic Structure of an HTML Document


  An HTML document is made up of elements, each defined by a start tag and an
  end tag. Here's a simple example of an HTML document:


  ```html

  <!DOCTYPE html>

  <html>

  <head>
      <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>

  <body>
      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
      <p>This is my first paragraph of text on my web page.</p>
  </body>

  </html>

  ```


  - **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: This declaration defines the document type and
  version of HTML.

  - **`<html>`**: The root element that contains all other HTML elements.

  - **`<head>`**: Contains meta-information about the document, such as its
  title.

  - **`<title>`**: Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser
  tab.

  - **`<body>`**: Contains the content of the web page, such as text, images,
  and links.

  - **`<h1>`**: A heading element, with `<h1>` being the largest and most
  important.

  - **`<p>`**: A paragraph element used to define blocks of text.


  ### Why Learn HTML?


  Understanding HTML is essential for anyone looking to create or manage web
  content. It is the foundation upon which all web pages are built, and learning
  it is the first step in web development.


  In the next lessons, we'll dive deeper into HTML and explore how to style and
  add interactivity to your web pages using CSS and JavaScript.
