title: The World Wide Web
content: >
  The World Wide Web, commonly referred to as the Web, is a vast information
  system that allows documents and other web resources to be accessed over the
  Internet. It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and has since transformed
  how we communicate, learn, and conduct business.


  At its core, the Web is built on three fundamental technologies:


  1. **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):** This is the standard language used to
  create and design web pages. HTML provides the structure of a webpage,
  allowing you to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.


  2. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** This protocol is used for
  transferring data over the web. It defines how messages are formatted and
  transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various
  commands.


  3. **URLs (Uniform Resource Locators):** These are the addresses used to
  access resources on the web. A URL specifies the location of a resource and
  the protocol used to access it.


  The Web operates on a client-server model. When you enter a URL in your web
  browser, the browser (client) sends a request to a web server. The server then
  processes the request and sends back the requested web page, which the browser
  displays.


  The World Wide Web is distinct from the Internet, which is the global network
  of interconnected computers. The Web is one of the services that run on the
  Internet, alongside others like email and file transfer.


  Understanding the Web's foundational technologies is crucial as you embark on
  building your first website. You'll be using HTML to create the structure of
  your site, and you'll learn how browsers and servers communicate to bring your
  web pages to life.
